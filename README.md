# Hardware Store Database Design


This project consists in the design of a database system using Oracle MySQL DBMS. 
Concretely, this project should simplify the everyday-work of the owner of a hardware store, helping to keep track of all the assets that are involved in a store of this kind.
The database must respect the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties of the transactions.
